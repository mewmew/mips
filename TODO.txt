* fix opcode of li instruction (001001 in r5900l?)
* missing CTC2 instruction (register encoding, add function mapping)
* missing LA instruction (takes 8 bytes; e.g. 80010020 `la      $t0, unk_800B0D00`)
* fix opcode of sltiu
* fix function of sltu
* check if llo and lhi instructions are part of r5900l
* check if sub and subu instructions are part of r5900l (could be pseudo-instructions for syntactic suger)
* check if mthi and mtlo instructions are part of r5900l
* check if trap instruction is part of r5900l
* figure out how target is encoded in j and jal instructions
